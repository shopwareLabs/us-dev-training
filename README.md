## Plugin setup

The plugin is inside a subdirectory. It is recommended to symlink this into your shopware/custom/plugins directory.

1. Clone this repository into your "projects" folder, not into shopware/custom/plugins directly!
2. Symlink the "SwagFaq" plugin directory into your shopware/custom/plugins directory.

```bash
ln -s /Absolute/path/to/us-dev-training/SwagFaq/ shopware/custom/plugins/
```

When done correctly, you should see the "sym-linked" folder inside your IDE.

## Presentation

1. Go into /presentation folder.
2. Open `presentation.html` in any browser.
